### Scenario

> To manage all servers within the stack using Ansible, the Nautilus DevOps team is planning to use a common sudo user among all servers. Ansible will be able to use this to perform different tasks on each server. This is not finalized yet, but the team has decided to first perform testing. The DevOps team has already installed Ansible on jump host using yum, and they now have the following requirement:

### Mission 
> On jump host make appropriate changes so that Ansible can use rose as a default ssh user for all hosts. Make changes in Ansible's default configuration only â€”please do not try to create a new config.

### Solution

```bash
            cat /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg 
# Since Ansible 2.12 (core):
# To generate an example config file (a "disabled" one with all default settings, commented out):
#               $ ansible-config init --disabled > ansible.cfg
#
# Also you can now have a more complete file by including existing plugins:
# ansible-config init --disabled -t all > ansible.cfg

# For previous versions of Ansible you can check for examples in the 'stable' branches of each version
# Note that this file was always incomplete  and lagging changes to configuration settings

# for example, for 2.9: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/stable-2.9/examples/ansible.cfg
[defaults]
remote_user = rose 
host_key_checking = False

```
